problem 2

data cleaning steps:create variable city\_state, resolution ; eliminate
cities with no race reported and wrong entry; limit race to black and
white for analysis

``` r
homicide = 
  read_csv("homicide.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1)
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    !(city_state %in% c("Tulsa, AL", "Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO"))) %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_sex, victim_race)

After data cleaning, there are  39693 cases recorded over the past decades. There are 5 variables included in the data. Possible NAs are dropped for better analysis. 


Compute 95% confidence interval for odds ratio of solving homocides
comparing male and female in baltimore and the each city in the complete
dataset

The confidence interval for odds ratio of homicide case in baltimore is
(0.325,0.558) with an estimated odds ratio of 0.426.

Among the rest cities in the complete dataset. New York NY has the
lowest odds ratio for comparing homicides solved between male and female
victims with the upper confidence interval lower than 1 ,suggesting
small difference between number of homicides solved for males and
females. Albuquerque,NM has the highest odds ratio for comparing
homicides solved comparing male victims and female victims with upper
confidence interval almost reaching 3.8, suggesting huge difference
between number of homicides solved for males and females.

problem 3

data cleaning step：babysex, father race and mother race are recoded and
malform is converted to logical value.

``` r

    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    babysex = fct_recode(babysex, "male" = "1", "female" = "2"),

Variable `babysex`,`blength`,`bhead`and `parity` are included in the
linear model. Based on interpretation of the model, there is a negative
intercept of -6125.3. All four variables have a positive estimated value
and are significant with p-value much lower than 0.05. The plot
displaying residuals Vs fitted values suggests a rather good fit for the
model except for some data points distribute randomly away from the
center. Specifically, the observed residual seems to be rather large for
fitted value of 500 ,750 and around 1500.

Comparing root mean square error for each constructed model, model 3
includes `babysex`,`blength`,`bhead`and `parity` has the lowest value,
suggesting the best fitness. The first model only includes`blenght`and
`gaweeks` has the largest rmse as expected due to limited number of
estimators taken into account. The last model includes
`bhead`,`blength`, `babysex` and all possible variable interactions has
slightly higher rmse than the second model. This could potentially be
explained by existing interactions between variables. In general. model3
turned out to be the optimal one after comparing rmse values, suggesting
the best fit among the three.
